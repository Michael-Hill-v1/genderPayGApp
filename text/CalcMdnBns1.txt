The Calculation:

A list is made of all male relevant employees who received bonus pay in the 12 months ending on the snapshot date.
This list is ranked from highest to lowest bonus pay.
The bonus pay of the man in the middle of the list is the median bonus pay for men.

A list is made of all female relevant employees who received bonus pay in the 12 months ending on the snapshot date.
This list is ranked from highest to lowest bonus pay.
The bonus pay of the woman in the middle of the list is the median bonus pay for women.

The median bonus pay for women is subtracted from the median bonus pay for men.
The result is divided by the median bonus pay for men, then multiplied by 100.
This number is the median gender pay gap in bonus pay.
