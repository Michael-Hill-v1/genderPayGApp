The Calculation:

A list is made of all male full-pay relevant employees.
The sum of hourly pay of these men is divided by the number of men.
This number is the mean hourly pay for men.

A list is made of all female full-pay relevant employees.
The sum of hourly pay of these women is divided by the number of women.
This number is the mean hourly pay for women.

The mean hourly pay for women is subtracted from the mean hourly pay for men.
The result is divided by the mean hourly pay for men, then multiplied by 100.
This number is the mean gender pay gap in hourly pay.
