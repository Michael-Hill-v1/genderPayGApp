We can use the Pay Quartile information from before to help visualise the calculation.  We already know which pay quartile women and men were in before these lists are made.  So we can draw a picture of each list, coloured in to show the pay quartile of the employees.  Then when we look at the woman and man in the middle of each list, we can see what quartile they're in, and get a better understanding of the size of the median pay gap.
