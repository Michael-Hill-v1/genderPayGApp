The Calculation: 

A list is made of all male relevant employees who received bonus pay in the 12 months ending on the snapshot date.
The sum of bonus pay of these men is divided by the number of men on the list.
This number is the mean bonus pay for men.

A list is made of all female relevant employees who received bonus pay in the 12 months ending on the snapshot date.
The sum of bonus pay of these women is divided by the number of women on the list.
This number is the mean bonus pay for women.

The mean bonus pay for women is subtracted from the mean bonus pay for men.
The result is divided by the mean bonus pay for men, then multiplied by 100.
This number is the mean gender pay gap in bonus pay.

Notes:

Bonuses might be a proportion of annual pay. So someone who works part-time might get a lower bonus than a full-time worker doing the same job. And lower earners might get a lower bonus than higher earners.

Some job types might pay higher bonuses. For example, maybe sales staff can earn higher bonuses than admin staff.
