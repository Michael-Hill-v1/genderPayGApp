Notes:

People who received bonus pay in the 12 months ending on the snapshot date but were no longer employed on the snapshot date are not included in these figures.

Bonus pay can include things like performance bonuses, incentive bonuses, commission, and long service awards.

People who recently joined the company might not be eligible for a bonus. So if a particular role has a high turnover of staff, fewer people in that job type will get bonuses. 

Maybe not all job types in the company are eligible for a bonus.
